There’s no closure, no answers. . . . Obviously it’s tapping in to something
the nation wants. I think it has to do with religious stirrings—a sort of New
Age yearning for an alternate reality and the search for some kind of
extrasensory god. Couple that with a cynical, jaded, dispossessed feeling of
having been lied to by the government, and you’ve got a pretty powerful
combination for a TV show. Either that, or the Fox network has an amazing marketing department..</p>
