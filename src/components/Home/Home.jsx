      <h1>The X-Files and the Delegitimation
  of the Nation-State</h1>
      <br/>
      <p>Imagine a television program that takes UFOs and other extraterrestrial phenomena seriously. Moreover, it assumes not only that aliens have actually visited our
planet, but also that the U.S. government is actively involved in a vast conspiracy
to hide that fact from the American people in a plot that reaches up to the highest levels in the chain of command. The series goes on to link that cabal to other subjects
beloved of conspiracy theorists—Watergate, for example, or the Kennedy and King assassinations. The series furthermore connects all these conspiracies to the international military-industrial complex and views the history of the United States since
World War II as one huge exercise in militarism, beginning with a deal with its former
Nazi enemies and including Nazi-like atrocities during the Vietnam War. With such a
dark view of the U.S. government and its role in world politics, would such a series
ever be permitted on the air by network TV executives? If programmed, could it possibly last a whole season? Would not the American public at some point wake up to
the subversive character of the series and hoot it off the air?
I am of course not making up this series but simply describing the Fox Network’s
flagship program The X-Files. Contrary to all normal TV rules, a show with such a
controversial view of U.S. history has been a solid success, completing seven seasons
on the air and still going, receiving high ratings consistently, being widely syndicated
in reruns already, and gathering fans all around the world as well as a cult following in
America. The remarkable and unpredictable success of The X-Files has to tell us something about the United States in the 1990s; it has to reflect a fundamental shift of
mood in the country.1 To be sure, the show did not reveal its deepest secrets all at
once, and one might argue that it initially hooked its viewers with intriguing science fiction plots and only gradually hit them with its shocking claims about the U.S. government. But even in its pilot episode, The X-Files was already suggesting that the federal government is hiding something, and the dominant mood of the show has always
been distrust of authority. Though not inconceivable, it is difficult to believe that a
show with such dark content could have achieved equivalent success in the 1970s or
1980s. Try to imagine a network in the 1970s casting James Garner as the hero in a
series called Jim Garrison: DA or Mark Lane hosting a PBS series called Great Performances: The Assassinations.
The success of The X-Files in the 1990s would seem to reflect a growing cynicism
in the American people about their government—a distrust of their leaders and a new
disposition to believe the worst about them, no doubt fueled by the seemingly endless series of political scandals that emanated out of Washington in the 1970s, 1980s,
and 1990s. Accounts of the genesis of the show reveal that when Fox executives were
concerned about its political content, they were reassured by audience surveys:</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Strangely enough, little mention was made at first of the show’s politics,
considering that the pilot and subsequent hours begin with the premise
that the government is behind widespread, covert activity to prevent the
public from learning about the existence of UFOs. [Fox executive Sandy]
Grushow does remember Jon Neswig, the head of Fox’s sales department,
raising the issue when the show was first screened, resulting in “some sparks
flying in the room.” Still, when Fox tested the show with what are called
focus groups . . . to gauge viewer response, no one even questioned the
notion. “The thing that was amazing to me in that test marketing was that,
to a man, everyone believed that the government was conspiring” to cover
things up, [X-Files creator Chris] Carter marvels. (Lowry 1995, 27)</p>
      <br/>
      <p>The X-Files found a way to exploit this political disillusionment of the American people, tapping into their developing sense that their government does not have their
best interest in mind. The fact that the show has been popular in many countries
around the globe suggests that it may reflect even broader developments, a worldwide
sense that politicians have failed to live up to their claims to be the saviors of humanity. But the political disillusionment goes even deeper. People do not just blame individual politicians for betraying their professed ideals; they have a more disturbing feeling that their political institutions themselves are failing them, and, above all, they
have come increasingly to question whether their national governments can solve
their problems. Indeed, some now believe that the nation-state is the problem, not
the solution, interfering with the free play of global economic forces and thus reducing people’s liberty and standard of living. Historians may someday look back at the
1990s as the decade in which the nation-state began to lose its legitimacy for a wide
range of people. If so, they may view The X- Files as one of the primary cultural reflections of this development. The show took government conspiracy theories that had
long been regarded as the lunatic fringe of political discourse in the United States and
brought them into the mainstream. Indeed, it transformed ideas that for decades had
been regarded as virtually paranoid into the weekly fare of television everywhere.</p>
      <p>One can see what an extraordinary development The X-Files represents in American popular culture by concentrating on the fact that, for all its science-fiction and
horror elements, it is fundamentally a series about the FBI. As a TV advertiser might
put it, however, this is not your father’s FBI—and certainly not J. Edgar Hoover’s.
Far from being the hero of the series, as one might expect on American television, the
federal agency is virtually the villain. Hoover actually appears in an episode called
“Travelers” that goes back into FBI history, and he is portrayed in a very negative
light as a rabid anticommunist, willing to go to any lengths to rid America of the Red Menace. At one point, he says: “If we are to defeat the enemy, we must use their tools!
. . . We must do those things which even our enemies would be ashamed to do.” One
of the writers of the episode, Frank Spotnitz, reports:</p>
      <br/>
      <p>We hired a retired FBI agent to serve as a technical advisor on the script.
This was a gentleman who’d been with the Bureau for twenty or thirty
years, and he was very offended by our script. He was angry that we would
even suggest that J. Edgar Hoover—whom he still calls “Mr. Hoover”—
would be involved in any of the plots, or take any of the positions that he
takes in the script. Then he told me that he’d never actually seen our show.
“But if this is the type of story that you’re telling,” he told me, “I can’t
imagine that it would be very popular.” (Meisler 1999, 211)</p>
      <br/>
      <p>So much for the ability of retired FBI agents to read the mood of the United States in
the 1990s. Active agents did not do much better. Chris Carter reports that he initially
received very little help from the FBI when he sought background information for the
show. It was only after The X- Files had become a hit that he started hearing from individual agents, some of whom arranged a tour of FBI headquarters in Washington for
Carter and the show’s stars, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson. Carter says that
his relations with individual contacts in the FBI are better now: “I’ve been able to call
and get good expert advice or information from these people. Still, officially, they
can’t say they endorse the show or that they are in any way connected to the show”
(qtd. in Edwards 1996, 79, 81). Given the way The X-Files portrays the FBI, the lack
of official endorsement is hardly surprising. To be sure, the individual FBI agents featured in the series, Fox Mulder and Dana
Scully, are presented as heroic figures, but almost everything they accomplish they
achieve in spite of the Bureau, not because of it. The X-Files presents the FBI as a vast
government bureaucracy, with bewildering, byzantine, and even Kafkaesque layers of
authority that make it impossible for Mulder and Scully to get clear guidance or support in their efforts to right the wrongs of the world. At times, The X-Files shows the
FBI hindering Mulder’s and Scully’s work simply out of bureaucratic inertia, incompetence, and all-around thickheadedness. But as the series developed, it began to suggest that the opposition to Mulder and Scully is the product of sinister forces working
within the FBI or at least exerting pressure on it from other branches of the federal
government. We gradually learn that this agency, which more than any other over the years has represented the federal government’s ability to uncover threats to its citizens, is being used as part of a plot to cover up the greatest threat the American people have ever faced—a worldwide conspiracy to aid aliens in taking over the earth.
In general, The X-Files is more likely to show the failures of the FBI than its successes. Indeed, in their very nature, the X-Files are tributes to the FBI’s limitations—
mysterious cases, chiefly involving paranormal phenomena, that the Bureau has failed
to solve over the years. These files have become the special province of Fox Mulder,
who is interested in any case involving mysterious or unexplained phenomena for a
personal reason. He believes that years ago his younger sister was abducted by space
aliens, and he seeks to find extraterrestrial causes behind paranormal events to validate
his suspicions about his sister and to help him locate her, or at least to find out what
happened to her. In the pilot episode, higher-ups in the FBI assign Dana Scully to
Mulder as a partner in the hope that she will discredit his investigations. Her scientific
expertise as a medical doctor is supposed to allow her to debunk his explanations of
phenomena in terms of occult causes. If there are genuinely mysterious forces abroad
in the world, evidently the FBI does not want to know about them—and it does not
want anybody else to know about them either.</p>
      <p>Thus, in its basic premise The X-Files suggests that the government is incapable
of dealing with a whole side of human life. It hands the deepest mysteries over to a figure whom it proceeds actively to marginalize (symbolically, Mulder’s office is in a
basement corner of the FBI building in the District of Columbia).4 It does everything
it can to thwart his efforts to uncover the truth and, if he ever does, to prevent him
from making it known to the public. The show in fact emphasizes that the government does not represent the public interest but has a hidden agenda that largely
reflects the self-interest of those in power. All this runs counter to the way the FBI has
traditionally been presented in American popular culture.5 Probably no branch of the
federal government has gotten more of a free ride from the mass media than the FBI.
Bureau agents have been the darlings of movies, radio, and television throughout
their history and were especially so in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. The notion of a
federal police force was originally very controversial—many regarded it as an unjustified extension of the federal government’s power, beyond what is specified in the
Constitution—but we seldom get even a hint of such controversy in media representations of the FBI. In perhaps the most celebratory treatment Hollywood ever produced—a movie called The FBI Story (1959)—the question of why a federal bureau of
investigation is necessary comes up briefly, but the answer is almost comic in its simplicity: “The country’s growing, and crime will grow with it.” This response makes
the FBI sound like a franchise operation on the model of McDonald’s—“over one billion criminals captured”—but it completely begs the constitutional question and
leaves us wondering why local police forces are not adequate for dealing with the
problem of crime, no matter how much it may be growing. Supporters of the FBI
would of course answer that the agency was needed to deal with new developments in
crime that local police forces were incapable of handling, such as criminals crossing
state lines in speedy automobiles. Opponents would counter that much of the
“growth in crime” was actually the result of the federal government’s outlawing of
innocent activities or at least of “victimless crimes,” as it did during Prohibition.</p>
